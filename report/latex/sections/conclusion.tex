\section{Conclusions}
The experimental results presented in the previous sections outline the benefits of performing vectorization and matrix blocking to achieve a significant speedup over a naive implementation. The key ingredient in the approach outlined above lies in the decision to map a tile of $2 \times 2$ floats to a single 16-bit integer (using a struct of 4 members with 4 reserved bits respectively). Through this construction, the algorithms outlined in the previous are accessible in a convenient form that lends itself to simply vectorize the load, quantize, round and saturate functions, while also enabling a simplified blocking scheme for quantized matrix multiplication.
