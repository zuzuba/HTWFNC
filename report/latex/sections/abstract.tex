\begin{abstract}
Neural Networks are a Machine Learning Model where a non-linear function
is applied to subsequent applications of matrix multiplication and vector addition.
In order to achieve state of the art results, a vast number are required for the model.
Generally, these parameters are encoded as either 32-bit or 16-bit 
floating point numbers, which lead to large memory requirements to store the parameters
of a trained model. Quantization is a method to compress these parameters to
an arbitrary fixed precision, while controlling the degradation of that model's precision.
We achieve this compression by narrowing the range of values in a single parameter matrix to
the minimum and maximum of the parameters in the matrix and subsequently encoding the values in the
parameter matrix according to a simple encoding scheme for the values in the narrowed range.
Once the values have been encoded, we are able to perform matrix multiplication on
the compressed values rather than needing to perform decompression at each step. The result is that
given a fixed bit-length for each of the compressed paramters, we are able to generate an
encoded parameter matrix where each parameter is encoded with that fixed bit-length while ensuring
only minute model degradation with significant memory savings.
