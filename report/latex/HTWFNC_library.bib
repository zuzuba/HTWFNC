An extensive amount of information is currently available to clinical specialists, ranging from details of clinical symptoms to various types of biochemical data and outputs of imaging devices. Each type of data provides information that must be evaluated and assigned to a particular pathology during the diagnostic process. To streamline the diagnostic process in daily routine and avoid misdiagnosis, artificial intelligence methods (especially computer aided diagnosis and artificial neural networks) can be employed. These adaptive learning algorithms can handle diverse types of medical data and integrate them into categorized outputs. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss the philosophy, capabilities, and limitations of artificial neural networks in medical diagnosis through selected examples.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},
