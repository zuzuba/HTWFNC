Project for the course "How to write fast numerical code"

Once you created the timing infrastructure, save the measured number of cycles in the files runtime_q.txt and runtime_deq.txt for the function quantize and dequantize respectively. The structure of the file has to be: dimension_of_the_matrix number_of_cycles as you can see in the file that are already uploaded.
